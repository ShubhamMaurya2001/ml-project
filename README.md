# MLOps Project

I tried to perform ML Engineering Operations on a synthetically generated dataset to see how fully deployable systems work like.

This project also made me aware of logging, exception handling and deployment on cloud platforms like aws. 
This project also made me start to get out of notebook mindset and build scalable and deployable systems.
